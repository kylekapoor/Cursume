# ⚡️ Cursume · Cursor for Resumes

**The first AI powered resume workspace that evolves with you.**

Cursume is your personal AI career assistant. You upload your resume once and never have to fight with formatting, rewriting, or restarting from scratch again. Just say what you need:

> 🗣️ “Add my Shopify backend internship.”  
> ✍️ “Rewrite this bullet to be more outcome driven.”  
> 🔍 “Tailor this resume for a Google SWE internship.”

Cursume updates the actual resume structure, saves version history, supports real time collaboration, and exports to PDF, DOCX, and LaTeX.
